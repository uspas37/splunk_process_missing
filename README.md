This SPL will search across host in Colgate's On-prem Unix/Linux Test/Dev environment and will determine all process running using process state module.
Once it gets an actual list of hosts and processes running on them, it will compare it with a list of host and processes that we are monitoring as per our procedures.

If not found, specific alerts will be triggered based on specific conditions.
